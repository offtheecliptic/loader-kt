# Library Loader

## Introduction

This is a simple library fdemonstrating the use of post-delegation classloaders for isolating plugins from their host components.

## Motivation

There are plenty of examples for Java, but few for Kotlin.  This means to fill that gap.

## Design Philosophy

Everything is interface-based. So the code is organized into pairs of files for interfaces and implementations.

## Overview of Code Organization

## Architecture



### Core Data Model

### Operations Module


## Usage

Maven coordinates: [offtheecliptic/loader 0.0.1]

### Import Statements

## Concepts

These are the key concepts the library deals with.

* **Class Loading**  - Loading a class from a class path.

* **Instantiation**  - Creating an instance of a class.

* **Initialization** - Initializing a newly-instantiated class instance so it can be used.

## Library Developers - Basics

### Maven 

To compile:
   mvn clean
   mvn compile
   mvn package

## Test

### Maven 

You can run the test cases using Maven.

To run, can do either of these:

java  -jar target/clocca-0.2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

kotlin -cp target/clocca-0.2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ....
